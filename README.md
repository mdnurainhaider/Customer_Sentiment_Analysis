# Problem Statement
Imagine an e-commerce company that wants to improve customer satisfaction by understanding the sentiment behind customer reviews. They aim to identify key factors influencing positive and negative sentiments to enhance their products and services accordingly.

# Project Scenario
Recently, I finished reading the life-changing book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. As this book significantly altered my daily life, work habits, and ability to build positive routines, I became curious about others' perspectives. After searching online, I found the book on Amazon and noticed a mix of reviews from readers. Inspired by this, I devised a plan to scrape these reviews, analyze the sentiments expressed by customers, and identify the factors influencing both positive and negative feedback.

# Project Goal
- Analyze customer sentiment from e-commerce website (Amazon) reviews to understand factors driving feedback.
- Provide insights into customer preferences and concerns for data-driven decision-making.

# Deliverables
- Data Collection: extract customer reviews and additional data from popular e-commerce websites.
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features; perform text preprocessing tasks.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment using NLP techniques.
- Solution and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations.

# Stakeholders: WHY CUSTOMER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS?
- Retailers: Whether it's on Amazon, Flipkart, or Shopify, retailers can benefit greatly from understanding customer sentiments. By learning from this project, they can refine their product offerings and marketing strategies to create happier customers and drive more sales.
- Authors & Publishers: Understanding how readers feel about their work is vital for authors and publishers. By uncovering insights from customer sentiments, they can improve future books, connect better with their audience, and boost sales and loyalty.
- Data Enthusiasts: Scraping Amazon reviews was no easy feat, and I realized there's a lack of accessible tutorials out there. So, I'm creating a comprehensive guide to help others navigate through similar challenges and empower fellow data enthusiasts in their projects.
