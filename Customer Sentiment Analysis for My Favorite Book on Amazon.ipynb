    "# Project Scenario\n",
    "Recently, I finished reading the life-changing book \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear. As this book significantly altered my daily life, work habits, and ability to build positive routines, I became curious about others' perspectives. After searching online, I found the book on Amazon and noticed a mix of reviews from readers. Inspired by this, I devised a plan to scrape these reviews, analyze the sentiments expressed by customers, and identify the factors influencing both positive and negative feedback."

    "I imported **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) to handle various natural language processing tasks, such as tokenizing text into words, which is crucial for breaking down customer  reviews into analyzable components. After that, I included **stopwords** from NLTK to filter out common words that do not contribute much meaning to the sentiment analysis, allowing the focus to remain on more significant words. Next, I used **word_tokenize** to split text into individual words, making it easier to perform further processing like removing stopwords and stemming. Then, I incorporated **PorterStemmer** to reduce words to their base forms and **WordNetLemmatizer** for linguistically accurate base forms, which helps in normalizing the text data. Last but not the least, I imported the **String** module to remove punctuation from the text, ensuring a cleaner dataset for **Sentiment Analysis**. "

    "I found that VADER Sentiment Analyzer performed better in this context of sentiment analysis for Amazon reviews of \"Atomic Habits.\" Considering the overwhelmingly positive sentiment observed on the main Amazon page with over 120,000 reviews and a high rating of 4.8/5 for the book, it's reasonable to expect a predominantly positive sentiment in the reviews analyzed. VADER's optimized approach for analyzing informal text, such as online reviews, resulted in a more accurate classification of all reviews as positive. While TextBlob offers a versatile toolkit, VADER's alignment with the characteristics of the review data led me to choose it as the preferable method for this task."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, I embarked on a thorough journey of sentiment analysis for customer reviews of \"Atomic Habits.\" Starting from importing essential libraries to classifying sentiment using both TextBlob and VADER Sentiment Analyzer methods, I meticulously navigated each step to derive meaningful insights. Through this process, I uncovered the remarkable positivity surrounding the book, reflecting its profound impact on readers. At least, I am really satisfied now that I digged into deeper and got to know most of the reviewers are thinking positive aboout the book. This project gave me confidence and the necessary skills to do further web scrapping and sentiment analysis. Probably, next time I will choose something where people have mixed reactions, so that the dataset would be more diverse and I can even more do some Feature Engineering and Machine Learning steps. Overall, the insights from this project should equip stakeholders with valuable guidance for strategic decision-making, emphasizing the importance of leveraging positive feedback and addressing potential areas for enhancement."
